## :information_source: About

Project created with the intention of practicing programming logic along with TypeScript to create the functionalities of this application. The entire structure for the requests of this application uses Async-Storage, which means local storage on the device.

Additionally, Try-Catch structures were used for possible errors that may occur during the execution of a request, the use of methods like include, among others.

## :interrobang: Motive

This project aims to put into practice the basic concepts of React Native in mobile development, such as the use of Async-Storage for requests and the mentioned functionalities, and the use of React Hook Form in conjunction with Yup for the inputs and their alerts.

In this project, the following items were created:

1. General listing of accounts.
2. Registration of new accounts and passwords.
3. Filtering of the general list of saved accounts.
4. Use of React Hook Form in conjunction with Yup.
